# BubbleSort
I am currently taking a certification course on data structures and algorithms in java. This is the start of my journey and I want to share my experiences. This project demonstrates a basic bubble sorting algorithm. 

Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares elements that are next to each other, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted.
Bubble sort has a Big O(n^2). 
For example, if you wanted to sort a list of 5 elements, worst case sinario, the outer for loop iterates 5 times and the inner loop also iterates 5 time for a total of 25 times. 
For small lists, bubble sort can be used, however, as the number of items increase so does the time complexity.
